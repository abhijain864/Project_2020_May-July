# Comparison of neural networks with human pyschological representations
**Abstract**:
[Peterson et al 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02164) attempted to evaluate the relation between deep representations and mental representations for making similarity judgments and see how well the former aligns with the latter. The similarity judgments, in turn are calculated by taking a weighted inner product of the feature representations of the two objects.  Results from the paper revealed that comparatively much better results were obtained when the weights were calculated using a regression technique rather than when they were considered to be constant unity. This seems to produce very favorable results and would indicate that deep learned representations can represent psychological representations. In this paper, we want to test whether this really is this case. We start off by replicating their work, testing using other state-of-the-art models and testing the models against adversarial attacks.

This was a group project where, we first replicated the paper - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02164.pdf and then extended it\

Then I and Sanket Agrawal under the guidance of our mentor Shashi Kant Gupta, Coodinator Brain and Cognitve Society, IIT Kanpur further extended it, and gave an entry in the 35th AAAI Student Abstract and Poster Program.

Unfortunately it wasn't selected but it was a great learning experience.
